## **1. Introduction**

Welcome to the **Task Management CLI Project**, a dynamic Python-based command-line application designed to create, manage, and filter tasks efficiently. Your role is to debug, enhance, and incorporate reusable components into this project while learning about open-source workflows and version control.

---

## **2. Coding Standards**

- Follow **PEP8** for code style and formatting.
- Ensure all added or modified code aligns with existing conventions.
- Use **meaningful variable names** and keep functions modular.

---

## **3. Documentation Standards**

- All public methods must include clear **docstrings** using the **Google Python Style Guide**.
- Update the `README.md` and inline comments for clarity when fixing or extending the application.

---

## **4. Test Coverage**

- Use the **`unittest` framework** for unit testing.
- Test coverage must increase for each PR.
- Ensure tests validate:
  - Task creation, deletion, and listing.
  - Date validation (using external components).
  - Duplicate prevention.

---

## **5. Git Workflow**

Follow **GitHub Flow**:

1. **Fork and Clone** the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   ```

2. **Create Issues** for bugs or enhancements.

3. **Branch Naming Convention**:
   - For bugs: `bugfix/<issue-number>`
   - For features: `feature/<feature-name>`

4. **Commit Messages**:  
   Use clear and descriptive messages. Example:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Fix #123: Add date validation for task due dates"
   ```

5. **Push and Open PRs**:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin <branch-name>
   ```

---

## **6. Issue Tracking**

- Use GitHub Issues to document and track all bugs and features.
- Each Issue must include:
  - A clear title.
  - A description of the problem or feature.
  - Steps to reproduce (if applicable).
- Example:
  - Title: "Fix #1: Prevent duplicate tasks in task manager"

---

## **7. PR Merge Process**

1. Submit a **Pull Request (PR)** referencing the Issue number (`fixes #<issue_number>`).
2. Ensure all unit tests pass before submission.
3. Request a code review from the **lecturer/reviewer**.
4. Address feedback and resubmit as needed.

---

## **8. Development Environment Setup**

- **Python 3.9+** is required.
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Recommended tools:
  - IDE: PyCharm or Visual Studio Code.
  - Linter: `flake8` for PEP8 compliance.

---

## **9. Review Process**

- PR reviews focus on:
  - Code quality and readability.
  - Adherence to PEP8 and documentation standards.
  - Adequate unit test coverage.

---

## **10. Communication Channels**

- **Microsoft Teams** for announcements and technical discussions.
  - `#general` for updates.
  - `#pr-reviews` for sharing Pull Requests.
